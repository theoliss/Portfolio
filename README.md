# Portfolio

This project is my personnal Portfolio. I have made it using Three JS to make it 3D, and there fore more original. 
This project was also an university project, and is based on the classe available in this github : https://github.com/Thomas-Jld/mdt-threejs

# Content 

All the models that are shown is this project were made by myself using blender (exept for the little chess pieces in one of the "experience" model, you can find the original file here : https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-chess-set-0f440e2b01ca42f8b3fdee8178c51f20)
